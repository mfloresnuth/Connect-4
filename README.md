This project is a two-player Connect-4 game developed as part of the COSC 1337 course (C++ programming). 
The game allows players to take turns dropping tokens into a grid, with the goal of aligning four tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Features:
Game Board: 6 rows by 7 columns grid, initialized with empty cells.
Game Mechanics: Players alternate turns to drop tokens into columns.
Win Condition: Checks for horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequences of 4 tokens.
Statistics: Tracks wins, ties, and win percentages for each player.
Replayability: Allows players to play multiple rounds and view updated statistics after each game.

Instructions:
Compile and run the program.
Players (M and F) take turns selecting columns (1-7) to drop their tokens.
The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full (tie).
Statistics on wins, ties, and percentages are displayed at the end of each round.
Players can choose to play again or exit the game.
